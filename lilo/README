This is a simple lilo for ppc.
In fact, it copies files around. PowerMac and CHRP is currently supported.

But two problems needs to be solved:
- On PReP we have no real bootloader because we can not acces any device
  at boot time. The kernel arguments are hardcoded in the zvmlinux binary,
  we need a way to modify that without recompiling the kernel. 
  We have to modify that cmd_buf[256] symbol somehow.
- On older PowerMacs miboot should be used, quik might be possible. 
  However, miboot can not read a config file right now. This will be
  changed in the next time. The current System.bin loads always a
  ramdisk.image.gz from a folder ":linuxboot:". lilo will store the root
  device in a file called "myrootdevice" and linuxrc stores that in
  real-root-dev. After linuxrc quits, the kernel mount the new value as
  root device and starts init.
  You can modify the /boot/System.bin with vi as example. But be very
  very careful when doing that, don't change the length of the file!
  Edit the file in replace mode. Look for "root=/dev/fd0". There are
  some whitespaces, you can enter your own stuff here.

You need hfsutils to copy files to your HFS bootpartition on a PowerMac.


An example lilo.conf looks like that:

-------------------------------------------------
# don't mess with the config file syntax ;)

# you want to set this root device to a valid value!
#boot=/dev/hda7
default=linux
timeout=10
# useless on chrp and prep
bootfolder=linuxboot

# blah
  #blubb
image = /boot/vmlinux
        root = /dev/sda2
        label = linux
        append = "blubber blah=blu"
image = /boot/vmlinux-2.2.15pre14
        root=/dev/sda2
        label = benh
image = /boot/vmlinux
        root = /dev/fd0
        initrd = /boot/initdisk7.gz
        label = 7install 
other = /dev/hda6
        label = macos   



The lilo.conf syntax:
- global options

boot =
 This is the partition number of your boot partition. On a
 PowerMac it must be in HFS format because we use the hfsutils to
 copy the files to that partition. On CHRP you need a 41 PReP
 boot partition, /boot/second from the quik package is stored there.
default =
 The label that should be booted per default. Must be present.
timeout =
 Time to wait for user input. Not implemented on Pmac old.  10 = 1 sec
bootfolder =
 Only for Pmac. Folder that contains your boot stuff, this
 folder will be blessed to mark it bootable.
image = 
 Path to a kernel image. At least one must be specified.

- per image options
root =
  The partition for the root device, must be specified
label =
 label of the image section. 
append =
 appendline for optional kernel parameters
initrd =
 optional path to an initrd.
copy 
 flag to force copy of the kernel and initrd to the boot partition.
 Always true on pmac old because miboot can't access ext2 partitions
other = 
 The partition of another OS, usualy MacOS.
