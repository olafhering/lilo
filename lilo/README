This is a simple lilo for ppc.
In fact, it copies files around. PowerMac new and CHRP is currently supported.
Support for PowerMac old and for PReP is planned. But two problems needs to be 
solved:
- On PReP we have no real bootloader because we can not acces any device at boot
time. The kernel arguments are hardcoded in the zvmlinux binary, we need a way 
to modify that without recompiling the kernel.
- On older PowerMacs miboot should be used, quik might be possible. 
However, miboot can not read a config file right now. This will be changed in
the next time. The current System.bin must be modified with ResEdit,
the root= is missing. Edit th CMDL ressource with Resedit and add the required 
options. Example:
root=/dev/sda7 video=atyfb:vmode17


You need hfsutils to copy files to your HFS bootpartition on a PowerMac.


An example lilo.conf looks like that:

-------------------------------------------------
# don't mess with the config file syntax ;)

# you want to set this root device to a valid value!
#boot=/dev/hda7
default=linux
timeout=10
# useless on chrp and prep
bootfolder=linuxboot

# blah
  #blubb
image = /boot/vmlinux
        root = /dev/sda2
        label = linux
        append = "blubber blah=blu"
image = /boot/vmlinux-2.2.15pre14
        root=/dev/sda2
        label = benh
image = /boot/vmlinux
        root = /dev/fd0
        initrd = /boot/initdisk7.gz
        label = 7install 
other = /dev/hda6
        label = macos
