The lilo for chrp write the file /boot/second onto a partiton "41 PReP
boot partition". If there is no such partition lilo will exit. 
If you specify the global option "activate" the boot partition will be
activated (see fdisk -l output).

The bootloader /boot/second was taken from the quik package.
